I have spent a lot of time neglecting to learn technique and finding the courage to be an ACTUAL singer. I had always thought being a singer isn't practical when deep down it was always my insecurities with my voice. It's been almost a year since I have been taking classes at Amber Light Studios and the improvement I have seen is more than I could ask for. I started with Ben, but had to take a brief hiatus. I could tell after a few classes with him I was going to be the singer I wanted to be. My primary teacher for most of my journey has been Cait, she is awesome!! The best teacher I've had in any subject. So kind, so relatable and knowledgeable. Since joining Amber Light I have progressed tremendously with their very consistent training method and even found the courage to audition for the Herb Alpert Music Academy which now I have a full ride through their program. It's all thanks to the team at Amber Light Studios. I have no plans on stopping my training at their school while I study full time. There's no better price out here for their contemporary with a touch of classical styled curriculum which is combined with the music I want to learn how to sing. I am so thankful to  Cait, Ben, Andrea and the rest of Amber Light Studios staff for helping me learn how to use my voice.\",\n",
